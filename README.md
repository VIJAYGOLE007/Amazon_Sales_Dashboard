# Amazon_Sales_Dashboard
Based on the content from the Amazon Sales Dashboard, here are three key insights:

Market Distribution:
The sales are unevenly distributed across markets, with two dominant markets accounting for 58% of total sales. The top market represents 32% of sales, while the second-largest contributes 26%. This concentration suggests a need to evaluate market-specific strategies and potentially explore growth opportunities in smaller markets.

Segment Analysis:
Customer segmentation shows a clear leader, with one segment accounting for 51.48% of sales, followed by another at 30.25%. The third segment contributes 18.27%. This distribution indicates a heavy reliance on the primary segment, which could be a risk. It may be beneficial to develop strategies to grow the smaller segments or diversify the customer base.

Product Performance:
The top-selling products are primarily Zebra brand printers and office supplies. The Zebra ZM400 Thermal Label Printer appears to be the bestseller. This concentration in specific product lines suggests an opportunity to analyze the success factors of these items and potentially apply them to other product categories to boost overall sales performance.
